    Our Favorite Trio found a metal bar. This bar includes various metal such as gold, iron, copper and ore.
    We do not know the quantity of each metal in the bar,
    but we know the proportions of the various alloys.
    For example: the gold and tin proportion is 1/3, gold and iron -- 1/4, gold and tin -- 1/2.
    You should calculate the proportion of gold in the entire bar.
</p>

<p>
    The proportions are given as a dictionary, where keys are alloy names and values are proportions.
    The alloy names are presented as strings, which are composed of metal names separated by a dash
    (Ex: "gold-tin", "iron-copper", "iron-gold-tin").
    The proportions are presented as fractions (<strong>fractions.Fraction</strong> date type. 
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/fractions.html">Read about this module</a>).

<p>
    You should return proportion of gold in the bar as a fraction (<strong>fractions.Fraction</strong>).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition: </strong> All tests are solvable.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Alloys names and proportions. A dictionary.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Proportion of gold. A fractions.Fraction.
